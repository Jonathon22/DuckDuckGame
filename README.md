# DuckDuckGame
In this Game we will create a Duck Duck Goose game .
First we will map out the content and steps to create this game. 
        1. We will need a index page that contains div classes for the buttons.
    - the buttons will consist of a button to reset the game, a button that tells you pass or fail, and a button to tell you level 1 or level 2. 
        
        2. We will need a html div class that contains the squares that will hold the pictures. 
        
        3. We will need to add a div for the timer to countdown how long you have to make a selection. 
        
        4. we will need to use event listeners, for loops, and conditional logic to differentiate when a selection is correct on incorrect.
